<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fixed Inclinometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis</li><li>Dual Axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fixed inclinometer market is primarily divided into single-axis and dual-axis types. Single-axis inclinometers measure tilt in one direction, making them suitable for applications where only vertical or horizontal inclination is needed. In contrast, dual-axis inclinometers provide measurements in two directions, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of an object's orientation. This versatility makes dual-axis models ideal for complex monitoring applications, such as in geotechnical engineering and structural health assessments, where precise angular data is crucial.</p></p>
