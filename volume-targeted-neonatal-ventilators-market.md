<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators market is segmented into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomies, providing direct airway access for infants with severe respiratory issues. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, utilize methods such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), enabling support without the need for surgical airway access. Both types cater to varying levels of respiratory support required for neonates.</p></p>
